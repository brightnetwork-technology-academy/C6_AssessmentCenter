# Day 1 Afternoon Exercises

We hope you have been enjoying your time at the Bright Network Technology Academy Assessment Days so far!

We recognise that we have a great breadth of ability across our participants during these days. While this is something we attempt to minimise as quickly as possible on the course, we have left this afternoon's activities fairly open to allow opportunity for consolidation for beginners and further learning for those with some experience already under their belt. With this, we have a few different proposed activities to keep you busy.

You will be assigned a random group for the afternoon but feel free to take time to learn solo if you would like to! Similarly, if you find that you would like to work with the people in your group for the afternoon then please do. Even if you are working solo, please do also bear in mind that you're all in the same boat so reaching out for help from your teammates should provide you some support, even if no one knows the answer.

You will be assigned to different groups for the full-day project tomorrow.



## Afternoon Activities

### Consolidation of today's content

If you are new to web development or coding in general, it may be worth going through the written content provided in the `Notes` folder which reflect what was covered during this morning's session

	- Starting once more from zero and building up the same website should help you understand the basics we covered today!
	- Don't be scared to add your own flair! Change things around. See what happened when you add to or remove different parts of the site from today

*Just a wee reminder that we consider the Javascript portion of the day as entirely optional so if you're getting a bit lost, we recommend focussing on specifically the HTML and CSS at the moment. This will mean that you will be able to contribute well during the group projects tomorrow!*

### Extend your website from today

Got an idea of how to improve our site from today? Try implement it! Specific examples can be found in the `Additional Reading` file in the `Notes/` folder!

### Make something new

Taking another website as inspiration (BBC News perhaps?), try copying what they've done. Do note that when you look on Dev Tools that the page is going to look quite weighty, so it may be worth using the "Inspect Element" button at the top left to select what you're interested in.

### Gamify your learning

Flexbox Froggy and CSS Grid Garden are both great for getting a kick-start on using flexbox and CSS grid (both of which are used to organise web content in two dimensions)
